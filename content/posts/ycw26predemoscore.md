Hundreds of startups, limited time, and asymmetric information make it hard to know where to focus. While some firms like [Lobster Capital](https://www.lobstercap.com/) concentrate on identifying the absolute outliers (top 2%), many funds—especially diversified YCombinator strategies like [Rebel Fund](https://www.rebelfund.vc/)—optimize for a broader top 10% to balance upside with portfolio risk.

This post introduces our **Pre-Demo Day Score**, a data-driven ranking designed specifically for that purpose.

## The Problem: Signal Fragmentation Before Demo Day

Pre-Demo Day evaluation typically relies on three incomplete sources:

1. **Private traction leaks** (selectively shared)
2. **Founder narratives** (often polished, rarely comparable)
3. **Market buzz** (noisy, but real)

Some investors lean heavily on insider datasets. For example, Lobster Capital’s widely circulated [YC W26 guide](https://lobstercap.substack.com/p/yc-w26-the-definitive-investors-guide) aggregates early traction signals (ARR, LOIs, usage, etc.). That level of depth may be sufficient for firms targeting only the **top 2%** of breakout companies.

But for funds building broader YC portfolios—like those explicitly optimizing for **top decile exposure**—this is not enough. You need a *systematic, scalable, and comparable* framework across the entire batch.

---

## Our Approach: A Hybrid Pre-Demo Day Score

We combine two different signal classes:

### 1. Traction (when available)

From publicly disclosed or leaked data:

* ARR and revenue signals
* Pilot revenue and LOIs
* Active users and activity volume
* Ecosystem pull (e.g. GitHub traction)

We apply a **VC-weighted scoring model**, where:

* Revenue dominates
* Engagement follows
* Acquisition and ecosystem signals are discounted

We then incorporate **velocity (MoM growth)** when available to capture momentum.

---

### 2. Market Attention (for everyone else)

The key insight:

> **Attention is not noise—it’s an early signal of market pull.**

This is supported by academic research showing that [web mentions correlate with startup success](https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3272011).

So we compute:

* Google/web mentions per startup domain
* Log-scaled distributions to handle extreme variance
* Relative share of total attention

---

### 3. Final Pre-Demo Day Score

For each startup:

> **Score = max(Traction Score, Attention Score)**

This ensures:

* High-traction startups rank highly even without buzz
* High-buzz startups are captured even without disclosed traction
* No company is excluded due to missing data

---

## What the Data Reveals

Across the YC W26 batch, attention and traction are **extremely unevenly distributed**:

* The **Gini coefficient is very high**, indicating strong inequality
* The **top 10% of startups capture a disproportionate share of total attention**
* The **top 2% dominate even more aggressively**, consistent with power-law dynamics

In other words:

> YC batches are not uniform—they are *winner-take-most systems*.

## Why Focus on the Top 10%?

Because portfolio construction matters.

* **Top 2% strategy** → maximizes returns, but requires near-perfect selection
* **Top 10% strategy** → captures most breakout companies while reducing miss risk

This aligns with the philosophy described by [diversified YC funds like Rebel Fund](https://jaredheyman.medium.com/on-hitting-the-bullseye-6295e99d2a89) that prioritize:

* Coverage over precision
* Exposure over prediction

---

## The Ranking: Where Attention Meets Traction

The final ranking is driven by the **hybrid Pre-Demo Day Score**.

What makes this ranking useful:

* It reflects **real-world investor competition signals**
* It captures both **fundamentals and narrative momentum**
* It highlights where **capital is likely to concentrate on Demo Day**

Most importantly:

> It shows *not just who is good*, but **who the market already believes might be great**.

## Key Insight for Demo Day Investors

By the time Demo Day starts:

* The top 10% is already partially “priced in” via attention
* The remaining alpha comes from:

  * Identifying *mispriced* startups within that top decile
  * Understanding *why* certain companies attract disproportionate attention

This ranking is a **map of that battlefield**.

## Final Thought

Demo Day feels like discovery.
In reality, much of the outcome is already shaped beforehand.

The goal isn’t to guess blindly—it’s to **read the signals early and systematically**.

That’s what the Pre-Demo Day Score is built for.
